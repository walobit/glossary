      <dt id="absolute-path">absolute path</dt>
      <dd>
        A <a href="#path">path</a> that always points to the same location.
        Absolute paths always start with the <a href="#root-directory">root directory</a>.
      </dd>

      <dt id="comma-separated-values">comma-separated values (CSV)</dt>
      <dd>
        A textual format for tabular data in which columns are separated by commas
        and records by newlines.
        There are many variations on CSV,
        differing primarily in how they handle quoted strings and empty columns.
      </dd>

      <dt id="command-line-flag">command-line flag</dt>
      <dd>
        An optional argument to a shell command that modifies its behavior.
        Most single-letter command-line flags in Unix begin with a single dash;
        longer flags usually begin with double dashes.
        Either type may take arguments, as in <code>-n 3</code>.
      </dd>

      <dt id="command-line-shell">command-line shell</dt>
      <dd>
        An interactive text-based program that enables a user to interact with the operating system.
        A shell typically only has a handful of built-in commands,
        and relies on external programs to perform most operations.
      </dd>

      <dt id="comment">comment</dt>
      <dd>
        Text that is included in a command or program, but ignored by the computer.
        Comments in the Unix shell begin with the <code>#</code> character;
        comments in languages like C and Java may use delimiters like <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>.
      </dd>

      <dt id="current-working-directory">current working directory</dt>
      <dd>
        The default directory associated with a running program;
        in the <a href="#command-line-shell">shell</a>,
        the directory the user is "in".
      </dd>

      <dt id="environment-variable">environment variable</dt>
      <dd>
        A global named value associated with the <a href="#command-line-shell">shell</a>
        that is inherited by all processes.
        Environment variables are typically used to store things like the user's home directory.
        See also <a href="#shell-variable">shell variable</a>.
      </dd>

      <dt id="filesystem">filesystem</dt>
      <dd>
        A way of organizing the files and metadata stored by a computer.
        The Unix filesystem is (mostly) hierarchical:
        directories are nested to form a tree,
        and files live in directories.
      </dd>

      <dt id="home-directory">home directory</dt>
      <dd>
        The root of a user's personal section of a <a href="#filesystem">filesystem</a>.
      </dd>

      <dt id="loop">loop</dt>
      <dd>
        A control flow construct that instructs a computer to repeat a set of operations zero or more times.
      </dd>

      <dt id="page">page</dt>
      <dd>
        To display a screenful of a file at a time.
      </dd>

      <dt id="parent-directory">parent directory</dt>
      <dd>
        The directory that contains the one in question.
        Every directory has a parent directory except the <a href="#root-directory">root directory</a>
        of the <a href="#filesystem">filesystem</a>.
      </dd>

      <dt id="path">path</dt>
      <dd>
        A textual representation of a location in a <a href="#filesystem">filesystem</a>.
        Paths can be <a href="#absolute-path">absolute</a> or <a href="#relative-path">relative</a>.
      </dd>

      <dt id="pipe">pipe</dt>
      <dd>
        A communication channel in the Unix shell that connects the output of one program to the input of another.
        Pipes are written with vertical bars, as in <code>a | b</code>.
      </dd>

      <dt id="prompt">prompt</dt>
      <dd>
        A message printed by the <a href="#command-line-shell">shell</a> to signal that it is awaiting input.
        The prompt can be as simple as a single <code>$</code> character,
        or include status information like the time and <a href="#current-working-directory">current working directory</a>.
      </dd>

      <dt id="redirection">redirection</dt>
      <dd>
        Sending the standard output of a program to a file,
        or reading the standard input of a program from a file.
        The former is written as <code>a &gt; file</code>,
        and the latter as <code>a &lt; file</code>.
      </dd>

      <dt id="relative-path">relative path</dt>
      <dd>
        A <a href="#path">path</a> that must be interpreted from a starting point.
        For example, <code>../a/b.txt</code> means "the file <code>b.txt</code>
        in the directory <code>a</code> in the <a href="#parent-directory">parent directory</a>
        of the current directory".
      </dd>

      <dt id="root-directory">root directory</dt>
      <dd>
        The folder in the <a href="#filesystem">filesystem</a> that contains everything else

      <dt id="shell-variable">shell variable</dt>
      <dd>
        A local name-value variable associated with a single process.

      <dt id="wildcard">wildcard</dt>
      <dd>
        A single placeholder character that can match zero or more actual characters in text.
